**COVID-Stigma-A-Dataset-of-Anti-Asian-Stigmatizing-Tweets-During-COVID-19**

This repository contains the Datasets (versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1) and labeling Instructions related to the paper 'COVID-Stigma: A Dataset of Anti-Asian Stigmatizing Tweets During COVID-19'. We present dataset version 3.0 containing 11,263 Tweets in the English language that are manually annotated into primary labels (_unknown/irrelevant, not-stigmatizing, stigmatizing-low, stigmatizing-medium, stigmatizing-high_) and Tweet sub-topics (for e.g., _wet market and eating habits, COVID-19 cases, bioweapon_, etc.). Further, we selected 5,000 Tweets from dataset version 3.0 and labeled them by a second annotator, then a third annotator resolved conflicts in labels between first and second annotators. We present this dataset version 3.1 as the highest quality Twitter dataset on stigma towards Chinese people during COVID-19 pandemic. This dataset can be used as a starting point for further qualitative research, as well as a benchmark for designing stigma-detection algorithms.
